# task-responsive-web
this is the first personal project task from arkademy, given at the end of week 3 to be presented at week 4

## HTML
HTML is a standard markup language for Web pages [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)

## CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as the foundation (every house has one), and CSS as the aesthetic choices (there’s a big difference between a Victorian mansion and a mid-century modern home).

How Does CSS Work? CSS brings style to your web pages by interacting with HTML elements. [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com/blog/css)
